# Significant changes in the JSON parser repo

## Release 1.0.1 2024-09-06

Add option `-L` to `jparse_test.sh` to skip error location tests. This is useful
in the case one has a different directory structure or the need of options that
change the paths causes incorrect error files.

`jparse_test.sh` now will try the default JSON strings files if no file is given
on the command line.

Updated man page `jparse_test.8`.

The new version of `jparse_test.sh` is `1.0.6 2024-09-06`.
