## jparse - a C JSON parser

This is a placeholder README.md for now as it's not time for the repo existence.
Although it works we want to make use of it on a wider scale before we make it a
separate repo.

The repo being created now is to make it so the code can be imported without
having to do this first. As well we want to set up workflows.
