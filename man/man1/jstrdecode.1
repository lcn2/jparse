.SH DESCRIPTION
.B jstrdecode
decodes JSON encoded strings given on the command line.
If given the
.B \-t
option it performs a test on the JSON decode and encode functions.
By default the program reads from
.BR stdin .
If given the
.B \-Q
option it will enclose the output in quotes.
If given the
.B \-m
(aliased as
.BR \-e )
option it will surround each decoded arg with escaped (backslash) quotes.
The use of
.B \-Q
and
.B \-e
together will surround the entire output with unescaped quotes and each decoded arg's output will be surrounded with escaped (backslashed) quotes.
.SH OPTIONS

.B \-h
Show help and exit
.TP
.BI \-v\  level

.TP
.B \-q
Suppresses some of the output (def: not quiet)
.TP
.B \-V
Show version and exit
.TP
.B \-t
Run tests on the JSON decode/encode functions
.TP
.B \-n
Do not output a newline after the decode function
.TP
.B \-N
Ignore and skip over all newlines input, for easier typing commands.
.TP
.B \-Q
Enclose output in double quotes
.TP
.B \-e
Surround each decoded arg with escaped double quotes
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0
decode successful
.TQ
1
decode unsuccessful
.TQ
2
.B \-h
and help string printed or
.B \-V
and version string printed
.TQ
3
command line error
.TQ

.SH BUGS
.PP
A known problem, at least with some terminal applications, is that one has to hit ctrl\-d (or whatever one has
.B EOF
configured as) twice in order for it to properly send
.B EOF
(this occurs in other applications as well so it seems to be a terminal problem).
.PP
If you have an issue with the tool you can report it at
.br
.IR \<https://github.com/xexyl/jparse/issues\> .
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Decode the JSON string
.BR {\ "test_mode"\ :\ false\ } :
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrdecode { "test_mode" : false }
.ft R
.RE
.sp
Note that we didn't quote it!
.PP
Decode input from
.B stdin
(send
.BR EOF ,
usually ctrl\-d or
.BR ^D ,
to decode):
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrdecode
 \-5
 ^D
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Decode just a negative number:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrdecode \-\- \-5
.ft R
.RE
