.SH DESCRIPTION
.B jstrencode
encodes JSON decoded strings given on the command line.
If given the
.B \-t
option it performs a test on the JSON encode and decode functions.
By default the program reads from
.BR stdin .
If given the
.B \-Q
option it will enclose the output in quotes.
If given the
.B \-m
(aliased as
.BR \-e )
option it will surround each decoded arg (after encoding it) with escaped (backslash) quotes.
The use of
.B \-Q
and
.B \-e
together will surround the entire output with unescaped quotes and each decoded arg's (after encoding) output will be surrounded with escaped (backslashed) quotes.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Show help and exit
.TP
.BI \-v\  level
Set verbosity level to
.IR level
(def: 0)
.TP
.B \-q

Show version and exit
.TP
.B \-t
Run tests on the JSON encode/decode functions
.TP
.B \-n
Do not output a newline after the encode function
.TP
.B \-N
Ignore and skip over all newlines, for easier typing commands.
.TP
.B \-Q
Enclose output in double quotes
.TP
.B \-e
Enclose each decoded string (after encoding) with escaped double quotes (def: do not)
.TP
.BI \-E\  level
Entertainment mode at level
.IR level .
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0
encode successful
.TQ
1
encode unsuccessful
.TQ

.SH BUGS
.PP
A known problem, at least with some terminal applications, is that one has to hit ctrl\-d (or whatever one has
.B EOF
configured as) twice in order for it to properly send
.B EOF
(this occurs in other applications as well so it seems to be a terminal problem).
.PP
If you have an issue with the tool you can report it at
.br
.IR \<https://github.com/xexyl/jparse/issues\> .
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Encode the JSON string
.BR {\ "test_mode"\ :\ false\ } :
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode { "test_mode" : false }
.ft R
.RE
.sp
Notice that we didn't quote it!
.PP
Encode input from
.B stdin
(send
.BR EOF ,
usually ctrl\-d or
.BR ^D ,
to encode):
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode
 \-5
 ^D
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Encode just a negative number:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode \-\- \-5
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Run test mode:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode \-t
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Have some fun:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode -E 1
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Have even more fun:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode -E 3
.ft R
.RE
