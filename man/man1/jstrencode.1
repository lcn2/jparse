.SH BUGS
.PP
A known problem with macOS Terminal is that one has to hit ctrl\-d twice in order for it to properly send
.B EOF
but this occurs in other applications as well so we note this issue here.
.PP
If you have an issue with the tool you can report it at
.br
\fI\<https://github.com/xexyl/jparse/issues\>\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Encode the JSON string
.BR {\ "test_mode"\ :\ false\ } :
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 ./jstrencode { "test_mode" : false }
.ft R
.RE
.sp
Note that we didn't quote it!
.PP
Encode a string containing an escaped double quote from
.B stdin
(send
.BR EOF ,
usually ctrl\-d or
.BR ^D ,
to encode):
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 ./jstrencode
 {"test\e"ing":false}
 ^D
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Encode just a negative number:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 ./jstrencode \-\- \-5
.ft R
.RE
