.SH NAME
.B jstr_test.sh
\- JSON string decoding and encoding tests
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jstr_test.sh
.RB [\| \-h \|]
.RB [\| \-V \|]
.RB [\| \-v
.IR level \|]
.RB [\| \-e
.IR jstrdecode \|]
.RB [\| \-d
.IR jstrencode \|]
.RB [\| \-Z
.IR topdir \|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Using
.BR jstrdecode (1)
and
.BR jstrencode (1)
the
.B jstr_test.sh
script runs a series of tests to make sure that both decoding and encoding of JSON strings work as expected.
This is important because if either is not working right then there will be a problem with the JSON parser as well as these tools that use the same routines that the JSON parser uses.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Print help and exit.
.TP
.B \-V
Print version and exit.
.TP
.BI \-v\  level
Set verbosity level to
.IR level
(def: 0).
.TP
.BI \-e\  jstrdecode
Set path of
.BR jstrdecode (1)
tool to
.IR jstrdecode .
.TP
.BI \-d\  jstrencode
Set path of
.BR jstrencode (1)
tool to
.IR jstrencode .
.TP
.BI \-Z\  topdir
Declare the top level directory of this repository.
The
.B topdir
directory must contain the source files
.IR jparse.c ,
.IR json_parse.c ,
.IR json_parse.h ,
.IR jstrencode.c ,
.IR jstrdecode.c ,
.I util.h
and
.IR util.c .
By default, the source file
.I jparse.c
is searched for in the current directory, and then the parent of current directory.
.sp 1
If
.BI \-Z\  topdir
is used on the command line, then the source file
.I jparse.c
need not exist in the
.B topdir
directory.
If
.BI \-Z\  topdir
is not used on the command line, and the source file
.I jparse.c
is not found in the current directory nor the parent of current directory, then this command exits as if there was a command line error.
.sp 1
Once the
.B topdir
directory is established, this command moves to that directory.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
.TP
0

.TQ
2
\-h and help string printed or \-V and version string printed
.TQ
3
command line usage error
.TQ

.BR jstrencode (1)
.TQ
7

.B jstr_test.txt
file
.TQ

internal error
.SH FILES
.I jstr_test.out
.RS
This temporary file holds the output of an decoded JSON string (via
.BR jstrdecode (1))
encoded by
.BR jstrencode (1)
which, along with
.IR jstr_test2.out ,
is used to to verify that decoding and encoding work.
If the file exists and cannot be removed the script will exit with an error.
In the script this file is the variable
.BR TEST_FILE .
When the script ends this file should be deleted but the script attempts to delete it, upon execution, in case it still exists or was created by some other process.

.SH NOTES
The JSON parser
.B jparse
was co\-developed by Cody Boone Ferguson and Landon Curt Noll (one of the IOCCC Judges) in support for IOCCCMOCK, IOCCC28 and beyond.
.SH BUGS
If you have a problem with the tool (not JSON itself! :\-) ) you can report it at the GitHub issues page.
