.SH DESCRIPTION
.B jparse_test.sh
tests each line in each file for valid JSON.
The file name
.I \-
means read from stdin.
At least one file is required.
If the
.I \-d
option is used it also uses
.BR find (1)
to look under the JSON tree for good and bad files (two kinds, see below) that must pass or fail respectively.
The normal files that must pass are in the subdirectory called
.I good
and the normal files that must fail are in the subdirectory called
.IR bad .
.PP
Another subdirectory must also exist under which are bad files that have corresponding error files.
These error files have the location of failure and specific error messages that must match the output of
.BR jparse (1)
and if they do not it is an error.
The purpose here is to make sure that error location reporting is valid.
.PP
If the
.I \-f
option is used then the strings in the file specified must be invalid JSON, and if any are not, it will fail.
It is on the user to make sure that they use the right file in order to get valid results, but having this option allows one to verify that the input is either valid or invalid, depending on what is needed.
If
.I \-f
is not given then the script will not run a fail test on any file.
.PP
The script keeps a log of all the tests in
.I jparse_test.log
for later inspection.
If the
.BI \-k
option is specified then the error file is also kept for examination.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Print help and exit.
.TP
.B \-V
Print version and exit.
.TP
.BI \-v\  level
Set verbosity level to
.IR level
(def: 0).
.TP
.BI \-D\  level
Set debug level to
.IR level
(def: 0).
.TP
.BI \-J\  level
Set JSON verbosity level to
.IR level
(def: 0).
.TP
.BI \-q
Set quiet mode.
This will be affect the JSON parser.
.TP
.BI \-j\  jparse
Set path to the JSON parser jparse to
.IR jparse .
.TP
.BI \-d\  json_tree
Set json tree to look for good and bad files under to
.IR json_tree .
.TP
.BI \-s\  subdir
Set subdirectory in
.I json_tree
above the
.I good
and
.I bad
directories.
To not specify a subdirectory specify
.I .
(dot) as the directory.
.TP
.BI \-Z\  topdir
Set the top directory (where the jparse binary and the test_jparse subdirectory reside) in order for the tests to work right, in specific situations.
If not specified, the script tries to determine the top level directory by first checking the current working directory for the file
.B jparse.c
and if this fails by checking for the file
.B ../jparse.c
and finally if that fails by checking for the file
.BR ../../jparse.c .
This allows the jparse test suite to properly run in the rare case where one has a copy of the jparse repo in a subdirectory of their project.
.TP
.BI \-k
Keep temporary stderr files in the directory for investigation.
This is only used for checking that location reporting in error messages is valid.
.TP
.BI \-L
Run error location tests.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0
all tests are OK
.TQ
1
at least one test failed
.TQ
2
.B \-h
and help string printed or
.B \-V
and version string printed
.TQ
3
invalid command line
.TQ
4
.B jparse
not a regular executable file
.TQ
5
couldn't create writable log file
.TQ
6
missing directory or directories
.TQ
7
missing JSON file
.TQ
>=10
internal error
.SH FILES
.I json_teststr.txt
.RS
The default file that
.B jparse_test.sh
reads from.
.RE
.I jparse_test.log
.RS
The log file kept by
.BR jparse_test.sh .
It will be removed prior to each time the script is run to keep the state of the file consistent with the run.
.RE
.I test_JSON
.RS
The default JSON tree with
.IR good ,
.IR bad ,
and
.IR bad_loc
subdirectories for files that must pass, fail and fail with the exact error (error location testing), respectively.
.RE
.SH NOTES
The JSON parser
.B jparse
was co\-developed by Cody Boone Ferguson and Landon Curt Noll (one of the IOCCC Judges) in support for IOCCCMOCK, IOCCC28 and beyond.
.SS Error locations
.PP
The purpose of this is to verify that the error locations are correctly reported.
The error files have the errors that
.BR jparse (1)
.B MUST EXACTLY
report.
.PP
Whenever a JSON file is added that has a syntax error that is needed to test that location reporting in the JSON parser error messages is correct, one must do the following things.
.PP
First change to the test subdirectory.
Assuming you're at the top level directory:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
cd test_jparse
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Then you
.B MUST
verify that the output of
.B jparse
on the files added is correct.
If it is you must then regenerate all the error files in
.I test_JSON/bad_loc
like:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
make rebuild_jparse_err_files
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Then you must go back to the top level directory and run the test suite:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
make test
.ft R
.RE
.PP
After that go back to the
.I test_jparse
subdirectory and run
.sp
.RS
.ft B
make test
.ft
.RE
.sp
and make sure that it also passes okay.
Assuming everything is OK you can then add the JSON files and the error files like:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
git add ./test_jparse/test_JSON/bad_loc/*.json
.br
git add ./test_jparse/test_JSON/bad_loc/*.err
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Finally commit these files and make a pull request to have them added to the repo.
.SH BUGS
.PP
If you have a problem with the tool (not JSON itself! :\-) ) you can report it at the GitHub issues page.
It can be found at
.br
.IR \<https://github.com/xexyl/jparse/issues\> .
.PP
If one is in the test suite subdirectory then one must
.B STILL
specify the subdirectory name in paths under that directory and no directory for the 
.B jparse
binary itself.
On the other hand, if the directory structure is not correct it might be that the script fails.
In other words, the test suite is meant to be run from the jparse (or a clone of the jparse) repo itself.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Run test suite from top level (repo root) directory:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 make test
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Run the test script from the top level (repo root) directory manually, without testing the files under the
.B test_JSON
subdirectory:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 ./test_jparse/jparse_test.sh
.ft R
.RE
