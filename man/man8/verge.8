.I jparse.l
and
.I jparse.y
files.

.PP
Determine if first version,
.IR 1.1.3 ,
is \(>= the second version,
.IR 1.1.4 :
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 verge 1.1.3 1.1.4 && echo \(aqfirst version, 1.1.3, is >= second version, 1.1.4\(aq
.ft R
.RE
.PP
The above will not show any output as the exit status of the command will not be 0.
.PP
Determine if the first version,
.IR 1.1.3 ,
is < the second version,
.IR 1.1.4 :
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 verge 1.1.3 1.1.4 || echo \(aqfirst version, 1.1.3, is < second version, 1.1.4\(aq
.ft R
.RE
.PP
The above will show the string
.B first version, 1.1.3, is < second version, 1.1.4
