# Command line utilities that parse, read and process JSON in different ways

We provide a number of utilities that work with JSON, which we describe below.
Others are in the pipeline and when they are developed this file will document
them as well. These utilities are described below.

If you want more information on the `jparse` repo, see the [jparse repo
README.md](https://github.com/xexyl/jparse/blob/master/README.md).

For information on the `jparse` library, see
[jparse_library_README.md](https://github.com/xexyl/jparse/blob/master/jparse_library_README.md).

For information on the testing suite see
[test_jparse/README.md](https://github.com/xexyl/jparse/blob/master/test_jparse/README.md).

We also do recommend that you read the
[json_README.md](https://github.com/xexyl/jparse/blob/master/json_README.md)
document to better understand the JSON terms used in this repo.

# jparse stand-alone tool:

As a tool by itself `jparse` takes a block of memory from either a file (stdin
or a text file) or a string (if the `-s` option is used) and parses it as JSON,
exiting 0 if it is valid JSON or non-zero if something went wrong, for instance
if it is invalid JSON.

<div id="jparse-synopsis"></div>

## jparse synopsis:


```sh
jparse [-h] [-v level] [-J level] [-q] [-V] [-s] -- arg
```

The `-v` option increases the overall verbosity level whereas the `-J` option
increases the verbosity of the JSON parser. The `-q` option suppresses some of
the output.

If `-s` is passed the arg is expected to be a string; otherwise it is expected
to be a file.

The options `-V` and `-h` show the version of the parser and the help or usage
string, respectively.


<div id="jparse-examples"></div>

## jparse examples:

### Parse the JSON string `{ "test_mode" : false }`:

```sh
jparse -s '{ "test_mode" : false }'
```

With `-v 1` it would report `valid JSON`.


### Parse input from stdin (send EOF, usually ctrl-d or ^D, to parse):

```sh
jparse -
[]
^D
```

### Parse just a negative number:

```sh
jparse -s -- -5
```

### Parse party.json file:

```sh
jparse party.json
```


<div id="jparse-exit-codes"></div>

## jparse exit codes

If the JSON is valid the exit status of `jparse` is 0. Different non-zero values
are for different error conditions, or help or version string printed.



<div id="jstrencode"></div>

# jstrencode: a tool to encode JSON decoded strings


This tool converts JSON decoded strings to their original data according to the so-called
[JSON data interchange syntax - ECMA-404](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404/).


<div id="jstrencode-synopsis"></div>

## jstrencode synopsis


```sh
 jstrencode [-h] [-v level] [-q] [-V] [-t] [-n] [-N] [-Q] [-e] [-E level] [string ...]
```


The `-v` option increases the overall verbosity level. Unlike the `jparse`
utility, no JSON parsing functions are called, so there is no `-J level` option.
The `-q` option suppresses some of the output, although this might not be all that
noticeable.

The options `-V` and `-h` show the version of the parser and the help or usage
string, respectively.

Use of `-Q` will enclose output in double quotes whereas the use of `-e`
will enclose each encoded string with escaped double quotes.

If you use `-N` it ignores all newlines. This does not mean that the JSON allows
for unescaped newlines but rather newlines on the command line are ignored, as
if the args are concatenated. Use of this option allows for:

```sh
$ echo foo bar | jstrencode
```

to not show:

```
Warning: json_encode: found non-\-escaped char: 0x0a
Warning: jstrencode_stream: error while encoding stdin buffer
Warning: main: error while encoding processing stdin
```

Instead you might see:

```sh
$ printf "foo\nbar" | jstrencode -N
foobar
```

`-E` is kind of undocumented but kind of documented: play with it to see what it
does, should you wish!  :-)

Running it with `-t` performs some sanity checks on JSON encode/decode
functionality and this is not usually needed, although the test suite does do
this.

If no string is given on the command line it expects you to type something on
`stdin`, ending it with EOF.



<div id="jstrencode-examples"></div>

## jstrencode examples

Encode `\"\"`:


```sh
jstrencode '\"\"'
```

This will show:

```
""
```

Encode a negative number:

```sh
jstrencode -- -5
```

This will show:

```
-5
```

Palaeontologists might like to try `U+1F996` and `U+F995`:

```sh
jstrencode "\uD83E\uDD96\uD83E\uDD95"
```

which will show a T-Rex and a Sauropod (includes Brontosaurus, Diplodocus,
Brachiosaurus):

```
ü¶ñü¶ï
```

whereas fantasy lovers might like to try `U+1F409`, `U+1FA84` and `U+1F9D9`:

```sh
jstrencode "\uD83D\uDC09\uD83E\uDE84\uD83E\uDDD9"
```

which will show a dragon, a wand and a mage:

```
üêâü™Ñüßô
```

whereas volcanologists might like to try `U+1F30B`:

```sh
jstrencode "\uD83C\uDF0B"
```

which will show a volcano:


```
üåã
```

whereas alcoholics :-) might like to try `U+1F37B`:

```sh
jstrencode "\uD83C\uDF7B"
```

which will show clinking beer mugs:

```
üçª
```

assuming, in all cases, your system supports displaying such emojis.

Of course you may also use this program to encode diacritics and characters from
other languages.


For more information and examples, see the man page:

```sh
man ./man/man1/jstrencode.1
```

from the repo directory, or if installed:

```sh
man jstrencode
```

**NOTE**: After doing a `make all`, this tool may be found as: `./jstrencode`.
If you run `make install` (as root or via sudo) you can just do: `jstrencode`.

<div id="jstrencode-exit-codes"></div>

## jstrencode exit codes

If the encoding is successful the exit status of `jstrencode` is 0, otherwise 1.
Different non-zero values are for different error conditions, or help or version
string printed.

<div id="jstrdecode"></div>

# jstrdecode: a tool to decode JSON encoded strings

This tool converts data into JSON decoded strings according to the so-called
[JSON data interchange syntax - ECMA-404](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404/).


<div id="jstrdecode-synopsis"></div>

## jstrdecode synopsis:


```sh
jstrdecode [-h] [-v level] [-q] [-V] [-t] [-n] [-N] [-Q] [-e] [-E level] [string ...]
```

The `-v` option increases the overall verbosity level. Unlike the `jparse`
utility, no JSON parsing functions are called, so there is no `-J level` option.
The `-q` option suppresses some of the output, although this might not be all
that noticeable.

The options `-V` and `-h` show the version of the parser and the help or usage
string, respectively.

Use `-Q` if you do not want to decode double quotes that enclose the
concatenation of the args.

Use `-e` to not output double quotes that enclose each arg.

If you use `-N` it ignores all newlines. This does not mean that the JSON allows
for unescaped newlines but rather newlines on the command line are ignored, as
if the args are concatenated.

`-E` is kind of undocumented but kind of documented: play with it to see what it
does, should you wish!  :-)

Running it with `-t` performs some sanity checks on JSON encode/decode
functionality and this is not usually needed, although the test suite does do
this.

If no string is given on the command line it expects you to type something on
`stdin`, ending it with EOF.



<div id="jstrdecode-examples"></div>

## jstrdecode examples

Decode an empty string (`""`):


```sh
jstrdecode '""'
```

This will show:

```
\"\"
```

Decode `"\"`

```sh
jstrdecode '"\"'
```

That will show:

```
\"\\\"
```

If you need to ignore newlines in input, use the `-N` option. For example, here
is the same command with and without the `-N` option:

```sh
$ echo '"\"' | jstrdecode -N
\"\\\"

$ echo '"\"' | jstrdecode
\"\\\"\n
```

Something to note is that this command will not convert an emoji or Unicode
character to its `\uxxxx` form. In fact, for reasons we do not comprehend, this
is perfectly valid JSON:

```json
{ "üî•" "üêâ" }
```


For more information and examples, see the man page:

```sh
man ./man/man1/jstrdecode.1
```

from the repo directory, or if installed:

```sh
man jstrdecode
```


**NOTE**: After doing a `make all`, this tool may be found as: `./jstrdecode`.
If you run `make install` (as root or via sudo) you can just do: `jstrdecode`.


<div id="jstrdecode-exit-codes"></div>

## jstrdecode exit codes

If the decoding is successful the exit status of `jstrdecode` is 0, otherwise 1.
Different non-zero values are for different error conditions, or help or version
string printed.

## XXX - the below is for tools that have not yet been written      - XXX ##
## XXX - uncomment the below once the tools have been written and   - XXX ##
## XXX - documented                                                 - XXX ##

This document was prior to setting up this repo and it describes tools to be
written (that were being worked on until one of us got sick). As such these
tools have **NOT** been written yet. Additionally there might be some changes
in how they work, when it is time to write them. As well, another utility is
going to be created. All of these will happen at a later time as there
are other things that are of higher priority. When the tools exist then this
note will be either removed (if the tools are complete) or modified (if the
tools are still being worked on but do exist).


## Introduction to this document

**NOTE**: Please see [json_README.md](./json_README.md) for some important **JSON
terms** used in this document.

There is a general lack of JSON aware command line tools that allow someone to
obtain information from within a JSON document.  By "obtaining information" we
refer to the ability to extract (and if desired, format) data, either as a whole
or in part, that is contained within a [JSON
document](./json_README.md#json-document).

There does exist multiple [JSON](./json_README.md) [APIs (Application Program
Interfaces)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) for various programming
languages such as: JavaScript, C, Java, Python, Perl, Go, Rust, PHP, etc.  This
[jparse repo](https://github.com/xexyl/jparse/) is
a rich JSON parser API C programs can use, as well as a semantic JSON check
interface for C.  However all those APIs require the user to "program" in a
specific language in order to do something as simple as obtain a selective [JSON
values](./json_README.md#json-value) from a [JSON
document](./json_README.md#json-document). With these tools we attempt to
address some of these problems.



## Scope of this document

In this document, we will concern ourselves only with [Valid
JSON](./json_README.md#valid-json) in the form of a [JSON
document](./json_README.md#json-document), where a document can be a file or
stdin. It must be [valid JSON](./json_README.md#valid-json) only because we can
only extract information with any degree of certainty from [Valid
JSON](./json_README.md#valid-json).

We consider command line utilities that _read_ information from a [JSON
document](./json_README.md#json-document) in the form of either a file or stdin.
In this document _we are not_ considering utilities that either create or modify
JSON.

If a command line utility is given an **invalid JSON document**, the utility
shall exit non-zero with an error message indicating that the [JSON
document](./json_README.md#json-document) is not valid JSON.  Therefore we're
only concerned with reading various information from an existing [JSON
document](./json_README.md#json-document) or stdin that contains [Valid
JSON](./json_README.md#valid-json).


## Common command line options

In this document, we assume that all utilities have at least the following
options:

```
	-h		Print help and exit
	-V		Print version and exit
	-v level	Verbosity level (def: 0)
	-J level	JSON verbosity level (def: 0)
	-q		Quiet mode, do not print to stdout (def: print stuff to stdout)
	-L <num>[{t|s}]	Print JSON level followed by a number of tabs or spaces (def: don't print levels)
	-L tab		Alias for: '-L 1t'

			Trailing 't' implies <num> tabs whereas trailing 's' implies <num> spaces.
			Not specifying 's' or 't' implies spaces.

	-l lvl		Print specific JSON levels (def: print at any level)

			If lvl is a number (e.g.: -l 3), level must == number.
			If lvl is a number followed by : (e.g. '-l 3:'), level must be >= number.
			If lvl is a : followed by a number (e.g. '-l :3'), level must be <= number.
			If lvl is num:num (e.g. '-l 3:5'), level must be inclusively in the range.

	-m		Maximum depth to traverse in the JSON tree
	-K		Run test mode and exit
	-o ofile	Output formatted JSON to ofile (def: standard output, - ==> standard output)
	-F fmt		Change the JSON format style (def: use default)

			tty		When output is to a TTY, use colour, otherwise use simple
			simple		Each line has one JSON level determined by '[]'s and '{}'s
			colour		Simple plus ANSI colour syntax highlighting
			color		Alias for colour (colour excluding you :-) )
			1line		One line output
			nows		One line output, no extra whitespace

```

Additional command line options will be added on a utility by utility basis.



## Common exit codes

In this document, we assume that all utilities have at least the following exit
codes:

```
Exit codes:
    0	all is OK and file is valid JSON
    1	error writing to output file (if -o specified)
    2	-h and help string printed or -V and version string printed
    3	invalid command line, invalid option or option missing an argument
    4	file does not exist, not a file, or unable to read the file
    5	file contents is not valid JSON
    6	test mode failed
...
 >=10	internal error
```

Additional exit codes will be added on a utility by utility basis.
