/*
 * A programmer's apology and warning:
 *
 * Sorry (tm Canada :-)) for the appalling condition of the code below.
 *
 * The people who worked on these tools and library did NOT write this code.
 * Well, OK, we DID write this comment and the code from jparse.y and jparse.l
 * as well as the other tools; we refer instead to the code in jparse.tab.c,
 * jparse.tab.h and their respective backup files jparse.tab.ref.c and
 * jparse.tab.ref.h generated by bison, and the jparse.c, jparse.lex.h and their
 * respective backup files jparse.ref.c and jparse.lex.ref.h generated by flex.
 *
 * WARNING: We do NOT recommend that you modify the generated code even though
 * it is digitally odoriferous and has a gleety appearance. Beautification of
 * this code, no matter how disagreeable it may seem, is unwise as such
 * modifications tend to be practically impossible to maintain. Even if this
 * Flying Spaghetti Monster style code tempts you to tweak it, doing so might
 * produce visions and nightmares of Cthulhu-like tentacles grabbing at the very
 * logic of your mind, pulling it down into a hideous maelstrom of code
 * maintenance cacophony.
 *
 * OK, it might not give you nightmares but why take the risk? The point is
 * don't work on this file! Instead work on the bison and flex related source
 * files. See the Makefile for details on how this file was generated. See also
 * run_bison.sh and run_flex.sh.
 *
 * Now some might be tempted to point out this code was originally in support of
 * the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC) and that objecting to the
 * output of Bison and Flex borders on programming sanctimoniousness. At first
 * glance, this incongruence is unsustainable. In response we opine that one of
 * the fundamental undertones of the IOCCC is the promotion of good programming
 * through irony by awarding highly obfuscated C code. So, if it helps, we
 * suggest you view this apology in a satirical light, even if you are humour
 * impaired. Nevertheless, we still recommend you to eschew modifying the code
 * below.
 *
 * Thanks in advance for your understanding, and sorry (tm Canada :-)).
 *
 * Of course, on the other hand, the fact the scanner and parser are for JSON
 * might suggest that we shouldn't have to apologise because the JSON spec is
 * objectionable and so are the generated scanner and parser so this apology
 * might very well be superfluous. If one were to then ignore the fact that
 * bison and flex do not care what they are parsing this same person could
 * argue, obviously by some perverted logical fallacies, that bison and flex did
 * their job well. Well, OK they probably DID do their job well but in an
 * objectionable way. :-)
 *
 * P.S. In 2022 April 04, when this comment was initially formed, none of the
 *	people working on this parser/scanner were Canadian. But some of them
 *	have several good friends who live in, or are from Canada. Those
 *	friends say sorry in a fun and friendly way, so we honour those friends
 *	accordingly.
